# vue-github-api

A deadly simple Vue.js plugin to consume GitHub API.

Head to [the extensive JSDoc API documentation for vue-github-api](https://clorichel.gitlab.io/vue-github-api/Vue_GitHubAPI.html), or keep on reading for an easy process to integrate it in your application.

## Using it

### Install and import

```bash
npm install vue-github-api
```

In your main application JS file (typically `main.js` if you are using [vue-cli](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli) webpack template), simply use the plugin:

```javascript
// vue-resource is needed too
import VueResource from 'vue-resource'
Vue.use(VueResource)

// import vue-github-api
import GitHubAPI from 'vue-github-api'
Vue.use(GitHubAPI, { token: 'user Personal Access Token' })
```

You can configure _application wide_ options while `Vue.use`'ing this plugin:

| Name    | Description                                                           |
|---------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `token` | one of your GitHub user _Personal Access Token_ to connect to the API |

### Consume GitHub API

From anywhere now, you can simply consume GitHub API:

```javascript
Vue.GitHubAPI.get('/projects', {}, [this.myGitHubData, 'projects'])
```

You can also use it in your `.vue` components with `this.GitHubAPI`:

```javascript
this.GitHubAPI.get('/projects', {}, [this.myGitHubData, 'projects'])
```

That was it! Now that you are bootstrapped in, have a look at all the methods available to you in the extensive JSDoc API documentation available on [these auto-generated GitLab Pages](https://clorichel.gitlab.io/vue-github-api/Vue_GitHubAPI.html).

**Important:** if you want your filled-in property `this.myGitHubData.projects` to be reactive "the Vue.js way", you MUST define this variable as a data in your components or vues, with a default value of an empty object (read `myGitHubData: {}`). See how to do it on a vue component on this example:

```javascript
<template>
  <div>
    <p>Repositories grabbed: {{ repositoriesCount }}</p>
  </div>
</template>

<script>
export default {
  data () {
    return {
      myGitHubData: {}
    }
  },
  mounted: function () {
    this.GitHubAPI.get('/user/repos', {}, [this.myGitHubData, 'repositories'])
  },
  computed: {
    repositoriesCount: function () {
      if (this.myGitHubData.repositories) {
        return this.myGitHubData.repositories.length
      }
      return 'none yet...'
    }
  }
}
</script>
```

This is due to the fact Vue does not allow to add new reactive properties dynamically. Read more about it on the awesome [Vue.js guide](http://vuejs.org/guide/reactivity.html#Change-Detection-Caveats).

During your application workflow, you could want to change GitHub user authentication token. This method will let you do it easily:

```javascript
// set application wide GitHubAPI token value
this.GitHubAPI.setToken('other user Personal Access Token')
```

## Vuex store module

Using Vuex? You can attach _vue-github-api_ Vuex module to your application store. Within one of your `.vue` components, simply register it before you using it from your application:

```javascript
// registers GitHubAPI Vuex module to your application Vuex store
this.GitHubAPI.registerStore(this.$store)

// you are now able to read this state
this.$store.state.GitHubAPI.downloading
```

Here are Vuex `states` provided by _vue-github-api_ to your application:

| Vuex state    | Type    | Description                                        |
|---------------|---------|----------------------------------------------------|
| `downloading` | Boolean | Defines if vue-github-api is currently downloading |
| `running`     | Number  | Count vue-github-api requests running now          |

Have a look at [Vuex](https://github.com/vuejs/vuex) for more details, or read on this complete example:

```javascript
import Vue from 'vue'

// your application is using Vuex
import Vuex from 'vuex'
Vue.use(Vuex)

// remember vue-resource is needed for vue-github-api
import VueResource from 'vue-resource'
Vue.use(VueResource)

// using vue-github-api
import GitHubAPI from 'vue-github-api'
Vue.use(GitHubAPI, { token: 'user Private Token' })

// declare your Vuex store
const store = new Vuex.Store({})

// this is your application
const app = new Vue({
  el: '#app',
  mounted: {
    // register GitHubAPI Vuex store!
    this.GitHubAPI.registerStore(store)
  },
  computed: {
    // with this computed property, do something insanely simple such as:
    // <p v-if="downloading">Downloading from GitHub...</p>
    downloading: function () {
      if (typeof store.state.GitHubAPI !== 'undefined') {
        return store.state.GitHubAPI.downloading
      } else {
        return false
      }
    }
  }
})
```

## Contributing

Initial scaffolding was done with [vue-cli](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli) webpack template. For detailed explanation on how things work, checkout the [guide](http://vuejs-templates.github.io/webpack/) and [docs for vue-loader](http://vuejs.github.io/vue-loader).

Simply said, one can start working on its own customized version of _vue-github-api_ in no time:

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# run unit tests
npm run unit

# build JSDoc API documentation (defaults to the ./out folder)
./node_modules/.bin/jsdoc src/GitHubAPI.js

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev
```
